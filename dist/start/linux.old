            <h1>Installing on Linux</h1>
            <p>Running Appweb on Linux is supported by building from source code. </p>
            <p>Please see instructions at <a href="source.html">Building from Source</a>.</p>

<!-- KEEP
            <p>The Appweb install distribution for LINUX is published in three formats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Native RPM format for RPM based systems such as Fedora</li>
                <li>Native Debian format for Debian based systems such as Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Tar format for custom/self installs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is recommended that you use either the native formats (if your system supports it) as these will
            register the software installation with the system's software manager. The self-install format consists of
            tar archives that you can manually extract for maximum control over the placement of the product files.</p>
            <p>All formats contain a binary distribution, documentation and development headers and libraries in the
            one package. During installation you will have the option of installing the full distribution or just
            portions.</p><a id="native"></a>
            <h2>Installing the RPM or Debian Images</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncompress and extract the image:
                    <pre>
tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-DIST-LINUX-CPU.FMT.tgz
</pre>
                    <p>Where VERSION is the current version (e.g. 1.2.3-1), and DIST is the name of the Linux
                    distribution (e.g. fedora), and FMT is either <b>rpm</b> or <b>deb</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Then start the installation with administrator privilege:
                    <pre>
sudo ./install
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol><a id="self"></a>
            <h2>Installing the Self-Install Image</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncompress and extract the image:
                    <pre>
tar xvfz appweb-VERSION-DIST-LINUX-CPU.tgz
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Then start the installation with administrator privilege:
                    <pre>
sudo ./install
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol><a id="removing"></a>
            <h2>Removing Appweb</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Change directory to the installation directory for Appweb. This is usually
                <b>/usr/lib/appweb</b></li>
                <li>Run the uninstall script in the install directory for appweb:
                    <pre>
sudo ./uninstall
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Running Appweb</h2>
            <p>Appweb will start when the Appweb installation procedure completes and on some systems, will launch your
            browser directed at the Appweb local home page.Thereafter, Appweb will automatically start if the system is
            rebooted.</p>
            <p>If you wish to manually stop Appweb, type:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appman start
</pre>
            <p>To restart Appweb:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appman stop
</pre>
            <p>Alternatively, you can run appweb manually:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
cd /etc/appweb
appweb
</pre>
            <p>Appweb is configured by default to listen on port 80. To test that it is serving pages, point your
            browser at http://localhost. To tailor the Embedthis Appweb configuration, including the default port,
            you may wish to edit the appweb.conf configuration file.</p>
            <p>To get all the options for Appweb, read the man page via:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
man appweb
</pre>or get the command help via:
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appweb --help
</pre>
