            <h1>Extending via Pipeline Stages</h1>
            <p>The Appweb request processing scheme can be extended by creating custom pipeline <b>stages</b>. Stages
            come in three varieties: Handlers, Filters and Network Connectors.</p>Handlers respond to requests and
            generate response content, filters permute incoming or outgoing data and connectors transmit responses to
            the client.
            <p>This document describes the pipeline stage interface and how to create Appweb handlers, filters and
            connectors. See the <a href="../users/stages.html">Configuring Pipeline Stages</a> document for
            background.</p>

            <h2>Handlers</h2>
            <p>The core Appweb HTTP server cannot serve any requests or generate responses by itself. It relies on
            request handlers to generate response content for HTTP requests. The standard distribution of Appweb is
            itself comprised of seven different handlers which serve all the content provided by an Appweb
            server.</p><a id="createHandler"></a>
            <h2>Creating a Handler</h2>
            <p>To create an Appweb handler, you need to call <b>maCreateHandler</b> and supply a unique handler name
            and flags that modify the behavior of the handler.</p>
            <p>The following demonstrates the creation of a "sample" handler.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
int maSimpleHandlerInit(Http *http, MprModule *module)
{
    HttpStage   *handler;
    <b>handler = httpCreateHandler("simpleHandler", module);</b>
    if (handler == 0) {
        return MPR_ERR_CANT_CREATE;
    }
    /* Define function callbacks */
    handler-&gt;match = matchSimple;
    handler-&gt;open = openSimple;
    handler-&gt;close = closeSimple;
    handler-&gt;start = startSimple;
    handler-&gt;writable = writableSimple;
    handler-&gt;incoming = incomingSimple;
    handler-&gt;outgoing = outgoingSimple;
    handler-&gt;incomingService = incomingServiceSimple;
    handler-&gt;outgoingService = outgoingServiceSimple;
    /* Set handler private data */
    handler-&gt;stageData = mprAllocObj(SimpleData, 0);
    return 0;
}
</pre><a id="createFilter"></a>
            <h2>Creating a Filter</h2>
            <p>Creating a filter is very similar to creating a handler. An MaStage object is created and
            initialized.</p>
            <p>To create an Appweb filter, you need to call <b>maCreateFilter</b> and supply a unique filter name and
            flags that modify the behavior of the filter.</p>
            <p>The following demonstrates the creation of a "compress" filter.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
int maCompressFilterInit(Http *http, MprModule *module)
{
    HttpStage   *filter;
    <b>filter = httpCreateFilter("compressFilter", module);</b>
    if (filter == 0) {
        return MPR_ERR_CANT_CREATE;
    }
    /* Define function callbacks */
    filter-&gt;outgoing = outgoing;
    filter-&gt;incoming = incoming;
    return 0;
}
</pre><a id="createConnector"></a>
            <h2>Creating a Connector</h2>
            <p>Creating a connector is similar to creating a handler. An MaStage object is created and initialized.</p>
            <p>To create an Appweb connector, you need to call <b>maCreateConnector</b> and supply a unique connector
            name and flags that modify the behavior of the connector.</p>
            <p>The following demonstrates the creation of a "turbo" connector.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
int maTurboConnectorInit(Http *http, MprModule *module)
{
    HttpStage   *connector;
    <b>connector = httpCreateConnector("turboConnector", module);</b>
    if (connector == 0) {
        return MPR_ERR_CANT_CREATE;
    }
    /* Define function callbacks */
    connector-&gt;outgoing = outgoing;
    connector-&gt;incoming = incoming;
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            <h2>Pipeline Stages Callbacks</h2>
            <p>Pipeline stages can optionally provide callback functions which are run at various stages of the HTTP
            request processing. If they are not provided, a default implementation is used.</p>
            <h3>match</h3>
            <p>This callback is invoked to test if the current request should be serviced by the stage. It is invoked
            after the request headers are parsed by the Appweb core and before running the request pipeline. If the
            callback returns false, the stage is removed from the pipeline.</p>
            <h3>open</h3>
            <p>This callback is invoked to give the stage a chance to initialize for a given request and potentially
            allocate any request specific data or state. It is called at the start of request processing after the
            <em>match</em> callback.</p>
            <h3>close</h3>
            <p>The <em>close</em> callback is invoked to give stages an opportunity to release any request specific data. It
            is invoked just prior to dismantling the request pipeline.</p>
            <h3>start</h3>
            <p>The <em>start</em> callback is invoked to start processing the response for the client.
            If the request is a form with Content-Type of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
            the start callback is called after processing all input client data. Otherwise, it is called before
            any input data.</p>
            <h3>ready</h3>
            <p>The <em>ready</em> callback is invoked once all the request body data has been received.</p>
            <h3>writable</h3>
            <p>The <em>writable</em> callback is invoked after receiving all body data and whenever the output pipeline
            can absorb more data.</p>
            <h3>incoming</h3>
            <p>The <em>incoming</em> callback is invoked to receive any incoming client data (typically POST or PUT
            data). It is called after the <em>open</em> callback and before the <em>start</em> callback.</p>
            <h3>outgoing</h3>
            <p>The <em>outgoing</em> callback is never called for handlers. Handlers generate data and send it downstream.
            Filters and connectors will have their outgoing callback invoked to receive data from upstream. The
            outgoing callback will be invoked after the <em>start</em> callback has been called for the handler.</p>
            <h3>Stage Data</h3>
            <p>Stages can allocate stage data and store it in the <em>stage-&gt;data</em> field. If the stage needs to
            store per-request data, it can store it in the stage's <em>queue-&gt;data</em> field which is unique for each
            request.</p>

            <a id="flags"></a>
            <h3>Stage flags</h3>
            <p>The create handler, filter and connector APIs take a flags word which modified the behavior of the
            stage. The flags can take the following values OR'd together</p>

            <h2>Packaging as a Module</h2>
            <p>Stages are usually delivered as loadable modules. In this manner, users can decide for themselves if the
            functionality provided by the stage is needed or not. Stages can also be statically linked. See the
            <a href="modules.html">Creating Modules</a> section for more information about how to create a module.</p>
