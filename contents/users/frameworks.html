            <h1>Web Frameworks</h1>
            <p>Dynamic web page creation needs a convenient and powerful server-side web framework. It is
            slow and difficult to create a functional and appealing dynamic web application using the legacy <a href=
            "#cgi">CGI</a> protocol. Its interface is too low level and it provides little assistance to
            manipulate server-side data, render UI elements, and manage Ajax interactions.</p>
            <p>In contrast, environments such as the <a href="#esp">ESP</a>
            provide much more support for dynamic web content. However, not all frameworks are
            equally suited for embedded applications</p>
            <p>Appweb provides a rich set of options to use when creating web pages or web applications. This document
            compares the alternatives and suggests where each option is best deployed.</p>

            <h2>Comparison</h2>

            <a id="esp"></a>
            <h3>Embedded Server Pages</h3>
            <p>ESP is a fast, efficient web framework that provides HTML templates, caching, Model-View-Controller paradigm,
            and an application and scaffold generator. ESP uses the "C" language code
            embedded in web pages for native-speed execution. It is very fast and compact.</p>
            <p>To prevent name clashes on Linux and MacOSX, when Appweb is installed, the "<em>esp</em>" program built
            by Appweb will be named "<em>appweb-esp</em>". This prevents clashing with the "<em>esp</em>" program
            installed by the stand-alone ESP installation.</p>
            <p>For more information about ESP, please see the <a href="https://embedthis.com/esp/">ESP Web Site</a>.</p>

            <a id="action"></a>
            <h3>Action Handler</h3>
            <p>The action handler is a simple Appweb request handler that maps URIs to C functions. It does not provide
            any other infrastructure or capabilities other than those offered by the Appweb APIs. Action routines
            are very fast, as there is very little code run before invoking the action. The action handler is ideal
            for simple bindings from URI to C code. Read more in the Developer's Guide under
            <a href="../developers/action.html">Action Handler</a>.</p>

            <h3>PHP Framework</h3>
            <p>PHP is a widely-used
            general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for enterprise Web development. It provides an
            object-oriented programming language, numerous extensions and a broad developer community. The power of PHP
            comes at a price, it typically has a memory footprint of more than 5 MB for the PHP code alone. For embedded
            systems, this is often too big and so we recommend using ESP instead.</p>

            <a id="cgi"></a>
            <h3>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</h3>
            <p>CGI stands for the Common Gateway Interface and it is the legacy extension interface for running
            external programs to generate dynamic data. It is standard but slow. Unless you have legacy CGI programs or
            need to run a scripting language via CGI, you are better served by using either ESP.
            For more information, please read <a href="cgi.html">Using CGI</a>.</p>

            <a id="fastcgi"></a>
            <h3>Fast CGI</h3>
            <p>FastCGI is an optimized CGI and is the preferable way to run CGI programs or to run PHP applications.</p>
            <p>Whereas CGI launches a new process to serve each and every request, FastCGI launches one or more CGI applications and then maintains a persistent connection to server multiple requests.</p>

            <a id="summary"></a>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>For embedded devices and applications: we recommend using <b>ESP</b>. It provides the fastest, most
            compact web framework without compromising on functionality.</p>

            <p>The following table may help summarize the differences:</p>
