            <h1>Configuring SSL</h1>
            <p>Appweb supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for authenticating systems and encrypting data.
            Use of this protocol enables secure data transmission to and from clients in a standards-based manner.</p>
            <p>This document provides step-by-step instructions for configuring SSL in Appweb. If you are unfamiliar
            with SSL, please read the <a href="sslOverview.html">SSL Overview</a> first.</p><a id="sslQuickStart"></a>
            <h2>SSL Quick Start</h2>
            <p>The default binary installation of Appweb will support SSL for all network interfaces. You
            can immediately test SSL access to documents by using the <b>https://</b> scheme.
            For example, to access the home page using SSL, use this URL in your browser:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
https://localhost/
</pre>
            <h3>Self-Signed Certificate</h3>
            <p>Appweb is shipped with a self-signed certificate to identify the web server.</p>
            <p><b>SECURITY WARNING</b>: This certificate is suitable for testing purposes only and
            your browser will issue a warning when you access the server. For
            production use, you should obtain your own service certificate from signing authorities such as <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>.</p><a id="sslConfigurationDirectives"></a>
            <h2>SSL Configuration Directives</h2>
            <p>Appweb uses several configuration file directives to control SSL and manage secure access to the server. These directives can be specified in the Default Server section or in a Virtual Host section. </p>
            <p>The relevant SSL directives are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCertificateFile">SSLCertificateFile</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCertificateKeyFile">SSLCertificateKeyFile</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCipherSuite">SSLCipherSuite</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#listenSecure">ListenSecure</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are some additional directives that are necessary should you wish to have Appweb verify client
            certificates. These directives are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslVerifyClient">SSLVerifyClient</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslVerifyIssuer">SSLVerifyIssuer</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCaCertificateFile">SSLCACertificateFile</a></li>
                <li><a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCaCertificatePath">SSLCACertificatePath</a></li>
            </ul><a id="sslConfigurationExample"></a>
            <h2>SSL Configuration Example</h2>
            <p>Consider the default Appweb SSL configuration in the appweb.conf configuration file:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
SSLCertificateFile "self.crt"
SSLCertificateKeyFile "self.key"
ListenSecure 443
</pre>
            <p>This set of directives enables SSL on port 443 for all network interfaces and uses the default supplied
                self-signed certificate to identify the server.</p>
            <p>The <a href="dir/ssl.html#listenSecure">ListenSecure</a> directive instructs Appweb to process requests
                from all interfaces on port 443 using current SSL configuration.</p>
            <p>The <a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCertificateFile">SSLCertificateFile</a> directive specifies the server
            certificate to use and the <a href="dir/ssl.html#sslCertificateKeyFile">SSLCertificateKeyFile</a> directive
            specifies the server private key for signing.</p>
            <p><b>SECURITY WARNING</b>: You must obtain or generate a SSL certificate before using this
            example in a production environment.</p>
            <p>The server key file is a PEM encoded private key. You may supply either an encrypted private key or a
            decrypted private key. If you use an encrypted private key, the server will prompt you for a pass-phrase to
            decrypt the key when the server boots.</p><a id="generatingKeys"></a>
<!--
            <h2>Generating Keys and Certificates</h2>
            <p>To generate a request file that you can send to a certificate issuing authority such as <a href=
            "http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>, use the following openssl command or equivalent command from your
            SSL provider:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
</pre>
            <p>This will generate a server key in the file "server.key" and will generate a certificate request in the
            file "server.csr" that you can send to the issuing authority. The issuing authority will generate a server
            certificate for your server and they will sign it with their private key. Subsequently, clients will be
            able to use the signing authorities public key to decrypt your server certificate and thus verify the
            identity of your server when negotiating a SSL session. When running these commands, you will be prompted
            to enter a pass-phrase password to decrypt the server private key. REMEMBER this password.</p>
            <p><b>SECURITY WARNING</b>: Safeguard the "server.key" private key jealously. If this falls into malicious
            hands, then your server identity may be hijacked by another site.</p><a id="sslProviders"></a>

            <h2>SSL Providers</h2>
            <p>Appweb employs an open architecture SSL Provider interface so that customers can select or create an SSL
            provider for their needs.</p>
            <p>Appweb provides multiple SSL implementations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MbedTLS -- designed for embedded use. This is the default SSL stack and is pre-integrated with Appweb. It is configured and enabled by default.</li>
                <li>OpenSSL -- designed for enterprise use. See <a href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The binary installation will use the MbedTLS provider by default.</p>
            <p>To build with OpenSSL, please consult the projects/README.md file included with the source code.</p>
