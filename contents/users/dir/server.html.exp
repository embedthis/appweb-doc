                            <p>The Action directive associates the specified program path with a document mime type.
                            The Action directive may be&nbsp; used to ensure a specific program is used to run CGI
                            scripts.</p>
                            <p>The CGI handler may match URLs by extension or by prefix path, depending on how the
                            appweb configuration file setup. When a match by extension occurs, the cgiHandler will
                            first see if an Action directive has been specified for the corresponding mime type for the
                            URLs extension. If one is defined, the specified program is run with the CGI script passed
                            as the first argument. If no action directive is found, the script is examined to see if it
                            contains a "#!/programPath" in the first line of the script. If it does, the specified
                            program is run with the CGI script passed as the first argument. If the script is a binary
                            executable or if the first line does not contain such a programPath, the CGI script will be
                            directly executed.</p>
                            <p>The default extensions in the appweb configuration file are: cgi, cgi-nph, bat, cmd, pl,
                            py, and php. For Linux, the default settings also include an Action directive for the php
                            extension. The other default extensions do not have Action directives.</p>
                            <p>The mime type may be added via the AddType directive or you may edit the mime.types file
                            to add the mime type. Mime type entries associate a mime type with a given URL extension.
                            For example, the following mime entry specifies that any URL with a ".php" extension should
                            will have the application/x-appweb-php mime type:</p>

                                via the ME_HTTP_HTTP2 compile time directive (default), then Appweb will support both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.

                            The Http2 directive allows the runtime control of HTTP/2 support. By setting the directive to "off", HTTP/2

                            It is imperative that this directive be used before any ListenSecure directives.
                            The HTTP/1 protocol is aways supported and cannot be disabled.

                            browser. The MIME types file included with Appweb follows the standard specified by
                            IANA.</p>
                            <p>The directory path may be an absolute path or it may be relative to the Home directory.</p>
                            <p>The MIME types file has lines of the format:</p>

                            <p>Feel free to modify the default mime types file, but be careful to save it as it will be
                            overwritten should you upgrade Appweb.</p>

                            account name. The account name chosen for the UserAccount directive should have minimal
                            privilege and should not be able to read or modify any files outside the Documents directory
                            or specified Alias directories.</p>
                            <p>If logged in as root or administrator, the pseudo name of APPWEB will change user to _www on
                            Mac OSX, nobody on Unix and Administrator on Windows.</p>
                            <p>If UserAccount and GroupAccount are defined, the supplemental
                            groups will be set to include only the specified group. This means you get one UID and one GID.
                            No supplemental groups.</p>
                            <p>If UserAccount is set and GroupAccount is not set, then Appweb will run with group membership set
                            to include all groups to which the user account is a member of.</p>
                            <P>The UserAccount directive can only be used if Appweb is started using a privileged
                            account such as root. Normally Appweb is started using the account root or administrator
                            and thereafter it changes to run with less privilege using the specified accountName.</p>
