                            <p>The NameVirtualHost directive specifies that an IP address will be used for name based
                            virtual hosting. Appweb provides two virtual hosting mechanisms:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>IP based</li>
                                <li>Name based</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>IP based virtual hosting uses a dedicated IP address for each virtual host on a server.
                            Name based hosting uses one IP address for a set of virtual hosts that are distinguished
                            from each other by a "Host" HTTP header.</p>
                            <p>The IPAddress argument may be "*" in which case addresses on which Appweb is listening
                            will use name based virtual hosting.</p>

                            <p>This example shows two virtual hosts with independent document webs. Both share the same
                            IP address and use the "Host" HTTP header to select the appropriate virtual host.</p>

                            the DNS server.</p>

                            <p>The VirutalHost directive defines a block of directives that will apply to the nominated
                            IP addresses. The IP addresses specify the set of IP addresses for this VirtualHost.
                            Note: this does not cause Appweb to listen on these addresses. You will still need an
                            appropriate Listen directive for each IP address. The IP address is of the form
                            IP:PORT where the IP or PORT portion may be omitted. The IP address can be set to "*"
                            in which case the VirtualHost will listen on all interfaces.</p>
                            <p>If the IP address is also specified in a NameVirtualHost directive, the virtual host will
                            use name based hosting. This requires the browser (as nearly all modern browsers do), to
                            include the domain portion of the URL in the HTTP host header. Appweb examines this header
                            and routes the request to the Virtual Host that has a corresponding ServerName</p>
                            <p>NOTE: Multiple IP addresses may be specified per VirtualHost directive.</p>

                            <p>The ServerName may begin with a "*" which means match any hosts that contains the following
                            host name. For example "*.example.com" will then match blog.example.com and www.example.com.
                            If the ServerName ends with "*" it will match any domain that contains the name. You can also
                            set the ServerName to a regular expression such that it will match multiple domains. Regular
                            expressions begin and end with a "/".</p>
