            <h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
            <h3>Debug Trace and Logging</h3>
            <p>Appweb has logging and request trace facilities that can help when debugging configuration issues or
            developing your application code that uses Appweb. You can vary the level of logging via the <b>--log
            logfile</b> command line switch for the <b>appweb</b> commands. The log command line switch has the
            format:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
appweb --log logFile:logLevel
</pre>
            <p>Use the <em>-v</em> switch to trace to the standard output at level 2.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
appweb -v
</pre>
            <p>The log level can be from 0 to 5, with 5 being the most verbose level.</p>
            <p>Similarly you can emit HTTP request trace using the <em>--trace</em> switch.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">appweb --trace traceFile:traceLevel</pre>
            <p>The <em>-v</em> switch will emit request trace to the standard output at level 2 combined with the
            error log.</p>
